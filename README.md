AWS Infrastructure Team Technotes
=================================

A place to collect learning and notes around various new AWS technologies.


Organization
------------

As the AWS Infrastructure Team works through POC user stories during our scrum
sprint activity, we generate informal usage docs.  These are organized by 
AWS service name.

The docs may also reference per-sprint git repositories located in codecommit.
